- A powerful deep learning architecture for image semantic segmentation
- CNN-based encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution
## In this code
- DeepLabv3+ == Modified aligned Xception + ASPP + U-Net style decoder
- In a training phase, random cropping and random scaling were employed and then resized to the fixed training image size.
- tf.\_\_version\_\_ == '1.12.0' ~ '1.14.0'
